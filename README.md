# Data-Warehousing-Using-Snowflake-and-AWS

## Overview:

This project showcases a robust dimensional model implemented using Ralph Kimball's data warehousing approach. Leveraging the powerful combination of Snowflake and AWS, we have designed a scalable schema, crafted a well-structured database, and implemented a seamless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) flow.
Key Features:

Dimensional Model: Follows the best practices outlined by Ralph Kimball to ensure an efficient and intuitive data structure.

Data Source: Utilizes the rich dataset from Instacart available on Kaggle. Check out the Kaggle Database - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data

Cloud Infrastructure: Leverages Snowflake and AWS for staging and destination, providing a scalable and secure environment for data processing.

Schema Design: Thoughtfully designed schema to optimize querying and analytics, enhancing the overall performance of the data warehouse.

ETL Flow: Constructed a robust ETL process to seamlessly move and transform data from the source to our Snowflake-based data warehouse on AWS.

## Getting Started:

Explore the Dataset: Dive into the fascinating Instacart Kaggle Database to understand the richness of the data.

Schema Design: Review our meticulously crafted schema to gain insights into how the data is organized for optimal analytics.

ETL Flow: Check out the ETL flow, which ensures a smooth transition of data from staging to the final destination.

## Technologies Used:

Snowflake: Cloud data warehousing platform for efficient and scalable storage and analytics.

AWS: Cloud infrastructure for hosting our Snowflake-based data warehouse.
